This was done as the Final Project for our Sophomore Year course on Data Structures and Algorithms. 
Phase 1 involved implementing text parsers and several arbitrage detectors. 
In Phase 2 we built an efficient market which can process trades from several entites using threads. We also built our own trading algorithm which detects small arbitrage opportunities and otherwise runs a median trading strategy in overall polynomial asymptotic time.
In Phase 3 we implemented statistical arbitrage detection across multiple markets.
